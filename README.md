## Build

To build the mobile app run the following command with the platform you'd like to build for (i.e. Android or IOS.)

## Using The Application

When you first run the app, it will prompt you for the URL of the **Myna-web** instance that it will fetch the surveys from as well as a **connection key**. The connection key is shown on the main page of your **Cohort** in Myna-web on the bottom right of the page.

Once this information is entered the app will download all the surveys involved in your Cohort. After that is complete you can log in as an enumerator and get the device location. On the location page, enter and confirm the school code for the school.

    Myna  facilitates Early Grade Reading Assessments (EGRAs). 
    EGRAâ€™s are used by 30+ organizations in 70+ countries around the world. 
    Myna has two main components, a web application that includes a survey 
    builder and dashboard and a mobile application that facilitates offline 
    mobile data collection on tablets or smartphones. Both components offer a
    full suite of device, survey, and form management.
